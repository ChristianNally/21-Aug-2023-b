### Rails Convo
* love it!
* matches the way we think about coding
* rapid prototyping
* the thinking is taken out of the equation
* don't have to come up with a project structure from scratch
* ecosystem might not have as many possibilities for front-end
* can be used to set things up quickly
* possibly too much magic?
* docs aren't very clear

* convention over configuration

### MVC / MVCR
* Model - handling data (abstraction layer)
* View - creating the HTML/helper functions
* Controller - brains of the operation
* Router - which controller to hand off control to




print
puts user.inspect
p user
